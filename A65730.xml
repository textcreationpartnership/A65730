         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

flood of deſtruction upon thy Inhabitants, O City of <hi>London,</hi> which
ſtands ready and is even at the door of the wicked; yea, the Lord God hath

into the Valleys; I will exalt my own Name in the Earth, I will ſet my King

yea, I do proclaim the day of Vengeance upon all fleſh that liveth in

is coming wherein the Heavens ſhall be ſet on fire, and the Elements
ſhall melt with fervent heat, and the lofty in that day ſhall be brought

you may all know it is near you, that ſo you may eſcape it by repentance;
ſo that all ſuch that have not wholly quenched the motion of the holy
Spirit of God, may now return at reproof thereof, whilſt it is ſtriving

leadeth unto Eternal Life; ſo that every man may come to know his Leader the
<hi>Lord of Hoſts:</hi> For all that are ſaved, muſt be led by the
ſaving Power which, redeems and brings up the ſoul of man out of death, and
out of captivity. O that I could cry aloud, and ſo loud that the ſons of
men may hear the ſound of the Glory of the Day of God which is now revealing.
O that every ſoul had a deep ſenſe of the Word of the Eternal Power
engraved in his <pb n="5" facs="tcp:58873:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>heart by the finger of the Lord God!
and unto the Nations that it ſhall hear, I do proclaim the Day of Free-love,

faithful, juſt and true, who hath a Remnant yet to gather of the Seed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> the Juſt, which Seed ſhall inherit all things; for with it
God hath made an Everlaſting Covenant: Therefore be ye awakened unto
Righteouſneſs, O ye Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth; for the Day is come wherein

the Nations that have been long wounded; yea, the Priſoners of hope ſhall
come forth rejoycing in the God of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who
ſitteth on the Throne of true Judgment. And now is the laſt Trumpet
ſounded, and an Alarm is given from the Lord God Almighty, proclaiming the
Day of Reſtoration and of mighty Salvation, and of glad-tydings unto the poor

the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo is the Son of Glory lifting up
himſelf, and he ſhall draw all men after him; and this is the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
the <hi>Elect and Precious,</hi> which ſhall grind all to pouder: Therefore,
hearken O Heavens, and hear O Earth, for the mighty Day of the Lord is come and
coming upon all fleſh, wherein the Mighty ſhall bow before Him, and the
ſtout-hearted ſhall be broken in pieces; for the day of Vengeance and the
year of Recompence is coming unto the Rebellious and hard-hearted, and the

Theſe ſhall ariſe in the glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; Theſe ſhall mount upward,

Tribes of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> Theſe who are come unto the everlaſting day of
God the Sabbath, the Reſt which God hath bleſſed for ever; Theſe
ſhall come unto the holy Mountain, where the Feaſt of Fat things is
prepared; Theſe, I ſay, ſhall come up upon Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where the
Song of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb</hi> is ſounded before his Throne,
who hath now appeared in his Eternal Glory; therefore bleſſed are all who
keep the Word of Faith, who dwell in the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Jeſus, ſuch ſhall
inherit the Promiſe of Life, which is to him that overcometh, for whom the
Crown is laid up; And ſo bleſſed are all whoſe Feet are upon the Rock,
the <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58873:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>Foundation of God which ſtandeth ſure. I will
make my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> ſaith the Lord of holineſs; and as
the Walls are about <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> even ſo is the Lord God round about
his People; and bleſſed are they that dwell in the defence of the moſt
High, they ſhall abide under the over-ſhaddowing of the Almighty in the Day
of Tryal that is coming on all fleſh; for God is, coming to try all
Foundations of the Sons of Men and tried ſtones are fit for the building of
the Houſe of the moſt High, living ſtones, elect and precious; Theſe
muſt be tryed through the fire, for there is a fire in <hi>Sion</hi> for the
purging and purifying of the Daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and ſhe
ſhall come forth ſhining in the Glory of the Lord God, whoſe day of
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing is come unto ſuch who have followed the Lamb through the waſhing
of Regeneration, who have been led through the great Tribulation; ſuch are
come unto the day of rejoycing, who are learning the Songs of the Redeemed,
which none can learn but they that come through the Fire, and through the
Floods, and through the Wilderneſs, and through the Red Sea where the Son of
Perdition is drowned; and now rejoyce thou barren Womb, which hath brought
forth the firſt Begotten of God, for more ſhall be thy Children than of her
that was the married Wife, for the Vine ſhall yield its increaſe, and the
bleſſing of the Lord ſhall multiply upon the works of his hands, his new
Creation; and the former Heavens are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing away, and the new Heavens are
created again, wherein the Son of Righteouſneſs ſhineth in his beauty,
where the Glory of the Lord filleth the Earth: And all muſt feel the
overcoming Life of Love to overcome; that is that which muſt remain Love to
the Brethren; and this muſt convince the World that we are of God, becauſe
we love the Brethren; and he that is born of Love, overcometh the World; and
ſo in the Faith that worketh by Love, the Victory is known; ſo by Love we
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as we know it to overcome in our own hearts: and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Love hath
no man received, than that Love which God firſt manifeſted in the Light of
his Son, who was and is the Foundation which muſt abide for ever. So in that
eternal Love which hath no evil in it, is this gracious Salutation ſent, with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58873:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>the voice of glad tydings unto the poor in Spirit,
unto whom the day of Deliverance is proclaimed. And this was upon me from God,
to publiſh this the Day of his Reign. So the Grace of God, the Father of our
Lord Jeſus, reſt and remain upon you all who fear him.</p>
